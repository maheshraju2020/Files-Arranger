# Files-Arranger

I wrote this code in 2015, to arrange the files present in my downloads folder. Over a period of time, we download a lot of stuffs and our downloads folder get overcrowded, and make our lives difficult to find the files which we need.

So keeping that in mind, I wrote this code, which will arrange all the files in various folders denoted by their respective extensions, and make our big directories neat and clean.

Note that, the extension list specified in this code is not exhaustive and I have used only common extensions.
